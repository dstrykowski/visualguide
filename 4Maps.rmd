## III. Maps
On a geographic basis, the music publishing firms that appear in the guide range from G. Ricordi in Milan to George H. Wigand in Göttingen, and from Novello in London to P. Iurgenson in Moscow. With the exception of several New York–based outfits, all of the publishers and journals were headquartered in Europe.

The composers represented here worked most often with publishers who were based in the same country, especially with regard to the publication of first editions (as shown here). Nevertheless, some published first editions aboard. Beethoven, for example, saw a significant number of works first printed in London. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, a few of the European composers (such as Antonín Dvořák) even began to sell their music to American publishers in New York. Edward MacDowell is presently the only American composer on the list, yet he placed a significant portion of his music with European firms

Select a composer from the menu below to see where his or her publishers were located on the map.


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(shiny)
library(leaflet)

composer_publishers <- read.csv(file = 'ComposerPublishers.csv')

composer_choices <- unique(composer_publishers$Composer, 
                           incomparables = FALSE) %>% sort

selectInput("chosen_composer", 
            label = "Select a composer:", 
            choices = composer_choices, 
            selected = "Beethoven", 
            selectize = FALSE)

output$ComposerName <- renderText(input$chosen_composer)

```

### Where Was the Music of  `r textOutput("ComposerName", inline = TRUE)` Published?

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
output$publisher_map <- renderLeaflet({
chosen_publishers <- subset(composer_publishers, 
                 Composer == input$chosen_composer, 
                 select = c(1:6))

chosen_publishers$Publisher <- c(paste("<b>", as.character(chosen_publishers$Publisher), "</b></br> (First editions:", as.character(chosen_publishers$Editions), ")"))

leaflet(chosen_publishers
    ) %>%
    addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLite,
        options = providerTileOptions(noWrap = TRUE)
    ) %>%
    addMarkers(~Longitude, ~Latitude, popup = ~Publisher, 
                 clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions
     ) 
})

leafletOutput("publisher_map", width = "100%", height = "800px")

output$ComposerName2 <- renderText(input$chosen_composer)
```
